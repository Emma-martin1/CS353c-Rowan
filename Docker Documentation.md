# Docker Installation

We initialize MongoDB inside docker so download and install docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) first.

# Docker Start

Open the command line application on your machine, `cd` to the project's root directory, type:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then you have a MongoDB instance on port `27017`. You should be able to connect it using Chrome or Firefox at `http://localhost:8081/`
